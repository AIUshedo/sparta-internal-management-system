# Sparta-internal-management-system

We were tasked with creating a Internal Management System using the 7 restful routes which we applied to our websites directory system.

We need to be able to Create, Read, Update and Delete a User, their Role, Cohort and that Cohorts specialisation so we can eventually track and log when a User checks a laptop in or out.

# How to use/run the Website Application Locally

1. Clone the repository to your local
2. Manually create the database called user_management then run the seed file
3. Run the 'bundle' command to automatically install all the gems/dependencies
4. Run the 'rackup' command on Git bash to run the server
